Garlic mustard	Alliaria petiolata	It is a herbaceous biennial plant growing from a deeply growing, thin, white taproot that is scented like horseradish.  In the first year, plants appear as a rosette of green leaves close to  the ground; these rosettes remain green through the winter and develop  into mature flowering plants the following spring. Second year plants  grow from 30–100 cm (rarely to 130 cm) tall. The leaves are stalked, triangular to heart-shaped, 10–15 cm long (of which about half being the petiole) and 5–9 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers  are produced in spring and summer in button-like clusters. Each small  flower has four white petals 4–8 mm long and 2–3 mm broad, arranged in a  cross shape. The fruit is an erect, slender, four-sided pod 4 to 5.5 cm long,[3] called a silique, green maturing pale grey-brown, containing two rows of small shiny black seeds  which are released when the pod splits open. A single plant can produce  hundreds of seeds, which scatter as much as several meters from the  parent plant. Depending upon conditions, garlic mustard flowers either self-fertilize or are cross-pollinated by a variety of insects. Self-fertilized  seeds are genetically identical to the parent plant, enhancing its  ability to colonize an area where that genotype is suited to thrive.[4]			Alliaria alliaria, Alliaria petiolata, Arabis petiolata, Erysimum alliaria, Sisymbrium alliaria	Mustard (Brassicaceae)	nonnative	invasive		Leaves can be eaten raw, used in salad and to make pesto. 					white	raceme	radial	4	May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept	alternate	simple	cordiform	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	round	hairless, hairy	61, 30	upright no/few branches	singular, bunches, patches		
Nodding wild onion	Allium cernuum	It has an unsheathed slender conic bulb which gradually tapers directly into several keeled grass-like leaves (2–4 mm wide). Each mature bulb bears a single flowering stem, which terminates in a downward nodding umbel of white or rose flowers. Nodding onion blooms in July or August. The flowers mature into spherical crested fruits which later split open to reveal the dark shiny seeds. This plant does not have bulblets in the inflorescence. This plant grows in dry woods, rock outcroppings, and prairies. It is native to North America from New York to British Columbia south to Virginia and Kentucky and south in the mountains. The bulb is edible and has a strong onion flavor. This species is cultivated for its attractive flowers. Allium cernuum form major has larger plants and larger flowers than the normal species.

Swamp milkweed	Asclepias incarnata	Swamp milkweed is an upright, 100- to 150-centimeter (39- to 59-inches) tall plant, growing from thick, fleshy, white roots. Typically, its stems  are branched and the clump forming plants emerge in late spring after  most other plants have begun growth for the year. The oppositely  arranged leaves are 7 to 15 centimeters (2.75 to 6 inches) long and are  narrow and lance-shaped, with the ends tapering to a sharp point. The plants bloom in early to mid-summer, producing small, fragrant, pink to mauve (sometimes white) colored flowers in rounded umbels.  The flower color may vary from darker shades of purple to soft, pinkish  purple and a white flowering form exists as well. The flowers have five  reflexed petals and an elevated central crown. After blooming, green  seed pods, approximately 12 centimeters (4.5 inches) long, are produced  that when ripe, split open. They then release light to dark brown, flat seeds  that are attached to silver-white silky-hairs ideal for catching the  wind. This natural mechanism for seed dispersal is similar to that used  by other milkweed plants.[4]				Milkweed (Asclepiadaceae)	native	hazardous		Can be poisonous.

Common milkweed, Silkweed	Asclepias syriaca	Asclepias syriaca, commonly called common milkweed, butterfly flower, silkweed, silky swallow-wort, and Virginia silkweed, is a species of flowering plant. It is in the genus Asclepias, the milkweeds.  This species is native to most of North America east of the Rocky  Mountains, excluding the drier parts of the Prairies. It grows in sandy  soils and sunny areas. It was one of the earliest North American species  described in Cornut's 1635 work Canadensium Plantarum Historia. The specific name was reused by Linnaeus due to Cornut's confusion with a species from Asia Minor. Common milkweed is a perennial herb growing to 1–2 m tall from a rhizome.  The stem and all parts of the plants produce a white latex when broken.  The leaves are opposite, simple broad ovate-lanceolate, 7–25 cm long  and 3–12 cm broad, usually with an undulate margin and a red-colored  main vein. They have very short petioles and velvety undersides. The fragrant flowers are grouped in several spherical umbels.  The individual flowers are 1–2 cm in diameter with five cornate hoods.  The seeds have long, white, flossy hairs and are encased in large follicles.

Butterfly milkweed	Asclepias tuberosa	Asclepias tuberosa is a species of milkweed native to eastern North America. It is a perennial plant growing to 0.3–1 metre (10 in–3 ft  3 in) tall, with clustered orange or yellow flowers from early summer to early fall. The leaves are spirally arranged, lanceolate, 5–12 cm long, and 2–3 cm broad. This plant favors dry, sand or gravel soil, but has also been reported on stream margins. It requires full sun. It is commonly known as Butterfly Weed because of the butterflies that are attracted to the plant by its color and its copious production of nectar. It is also the larval food plant of the Queen and Monarch butterflies. Hummingbirds, bees and other insects are also attracted.[2] Extracts were used by Native Americans as an expectorant for wet coughs and other pulmonary ailments.[citation needed] Use of the herb is contraindicated in pregnancy, during lactation or with infants due to the small amount of cardiac glycosides.

Black mustard	Brassica nigra	The plant is believed to be native to the southern Mediterranean region of Europe and possibly South Asia where it has been cultivated for thousands of years. The spice is generally made from ground seeds of the plant, with the seed coats  removed. The small (1 mm) seeds are hard and vary in color from dark  brown to black. They are flavorful, although they have almost no aroma.  The seeds are commonly used in Indian cuisine, for example in curry, where it is known as rai. The seeds are usually thrown into hot oil or ghee,  after which they pop, releasing a characteristic nutty flavor. The  seeds have a significant amount of fatty oil. This oil is used often as cooking oil in India.

Hedge bindweed	Calystegia sepium	Calystegia sepium (larger bindweed, hedge bindweed, Rutland beauty, bugle vine, heavenly trumpets, bellbind) (formerly Convolvulus sepium) is a species of bindweed, with a subcosmopolitan distribution throughout the temperate Northern and Southern hemispheres. It is an herbaceous perennial that twines around other plants, in a counter-clockwise direction, to a height of up to 2-4 m, rarely 5 m. The pale matte green leaves are arranged spirally, simple, pointed at the tip and arrowhead shaped, 5-10 cm long and 3-7 cm broad. The flowers are produced from late spring to the end of summer. In the bud, they are covered by large bracts which remain and continue to cover sepals. The open flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3-7 cm diameter, white, or pale pink with white stripes. After flowering the fruit develops as an almost spherical capsule 1 cm diameter containing two to four large, black seeds that are shaped like quartered oranges. The seeds disperse and thrive in fields, borders, roadsides and open woods.

Harebell, Bellflower	Campanula rotundifolia	Basal leaves are rounded to heart-shaped, usually slightly toothed, with prominent hydathodes, and often wither early. Leaves on flowering stems are long and thin and the upper ones are unstemmed. Flowers have five violet-blue, pink, or white petals fused together into a bell shape, about 15 mm (0.6 in) long and five long, pointed green sepals  behind them. The petal lobes are triangular and curve outwards. They  bloom on long thin stems either singly or in loose clusters from late spring to autumn. The flowers are pollinated by bees, but can self-pollinate. The seeds are produced in a capsule about 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in)  diameter. The seeds are released by pores at the base of the capsule.  Seedlings are minute, but established plants can compete with tall  grass. Like other Campanulas, all parts of the plant exude white latex when injured or broken.

Shepherd's-purse	Capsella bursa-pastoris	C. bursa-pastoris plants grow from a rosette  of lobed leaves at the base. From the base emerges a stem about 0.2 to  0.5 meters tall, which bears a few pointed leaves which partly grasp the  stem. The flowers are white and small, in loose racemes, and produce seed pods which are heart-shaped.[6] Like a number of other plants in several plant families, its seeds contain a substance known as mucilage, a condition known as myxospermy.[8] The adaptive value of myxospermy is unknown,[8] although the fact that mucilage becomes sticky when wet has led some to propose that C. bursa-pastoris traps insects which then provide nutrients to the seedling, which would make it protocarnivorous.[9]			Bursa bursa-pastoris, Bursa gracilis, Bursa rubella, Capsella rubella, Thlaspi bursa-pastoris	Mustard (Brassicaceae)	nonnative								white	raceme	radial	4	Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug	basal	simple	lobed	lobed	no	branched	round	hairless, fuzzy, hairy	43, 20	upright no/few branches	singular, bunches

It is native to Europe but introduced  elsewhere. Mouse-ear chickweed's identifying characteristics are  tear-shaped leaves growing opposite one another in a star pattern, hairy  leaves, and small white flowers. Mouse-ear chickweed typically grows to  4"-8" tall vertically and spreads horizontally along the ground via the  formation of roots wherever the stem falls over and contacts the  ground.

Bull thistle	Cirsium vulgare	It is a tall biennial or short-lived monocarpic thistle, forming a rosette of leaves and a taproot up to 70 cm long in the first year, and a flowering  stem 1–1.5 m tall in the second (rarely third or fourth) year. The stem  is winged, with numerous longitudinal spine-tipped wings along its full  length. The leaves are stoutly spined, grey-green, deeply lobed; the  basal leaves up to 15–25 cm long, with smaller leaves on the upper part  of the flower stem; the leaf lobes are spear-shaped (from which the  English name derives). The inflorescence is 2.5–5 cm diameter, pink-purple, with all the florets of similar form (no division into disc and ray florets). The seeds are 5 mm long, with a downy pappus, which assists in wind dispersal. As in other species of Cirsium (but unlike species in the related genus Carduus), the pappus hairs are feathery with fine side hairs			Carduus lanceolatus, Carduus vulgaris, Cirsium lanceolatum	Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	nonnative	invasive							purple, pink	panicle, corymb, raceme	bilateral	more	Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	alternate	simple	lobed	lobed	no	branched	round, ridged	prickly, hairy	152, 36	upright branching	singular		
Canada horseweed	Conyza canadensis	Conyza canadensis (formerly Erigeron canadensis L.) is an annual plant native throughout most of North America and Central America. Common names include Horseweed, Canadian Horseweed, Canadian Fleabane, Coltstail, Marestail and Butterweed. It is an annual plant growing to 1.5 m tall, with sparsely hairy stems. The leaves are slender, 2–10 cm long and up to 1 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers are produced in dense inflorescences 1 cm in diameter, with a ring of white or pale purple ray florets and a centre of yellow disc florets. Horseweed is commonly considered a weed, and in Ohio it has been declared a noxious weed.[1]  It can be found in fields, meadows, and gardens throughout its native  range. Horseweed infestations have reduced soybean yields by as much as  83%. It is an especially problematic weed in no-till agriculture, as it  is often resistant to glyphosate and other herbicides. Farmers are advised to include 2,4-D or dicamba in a burndown application prior to planting to control horseweed. Horseweed is much the most common of the alien Conyza species in Britain, and is found from northern Scotland to Cornwall. It is the only one of the British Conyza  species that grows as a weed of arable land: the others are casuals of  waste and disturbed ground in towns and by roads and railways. It is not  invasive of any natural or semi-natural habitats. C. canadensis can easily be confused with C. sumatrensis, which may grow to a height of 2 m, and the more hairy C. bonariensis which does not exceed 1 m. C. canadensis is distinguished by bracts  that have a brownish inner surface and no red dot at the tip, and are  almost free of the hairs found on the bracts of the other species.[2]			Erigeron canadensis, Leptilon canadense	Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	native								white	panicle	bilateral	more	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	alternate	simple	lobed, linear, spatulate	lobed, coarsely toothed	no	branched	round, ridged	hairy	104, 48	upright no/few branches, upright branching	patches, bunches, singular

It is a deciduous shrub growing to 5 m tall. The leaves are opposite, 10 cm long and 7 cm broad, oval with an acute apex. The flowers are produced in cymes. The fruit is a small blue drupe.[2]			Cornus obliqua, Cornus purpusii, Cornus sericea	Dogwood (Cornaceae)	native								white	cyme	radial	4	May, Jun	opposite	simple	ovate, elliptic	entire	yes	branched	round	hairless, fuzzy	203, 203	upright branching	patches, bunches, singular		
Gray dogwood, Northern swamp dogwood	Cornus racemosa	Cornus racemosa (northern swamp dogwood, gray dogwood or panicle dogwood) is a shrubby plant native to southeastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It is a member of the dogwood genus Cornus and the family Cornaceae. Plants can produce many stems and suckers, with older stems, which  can reach 5 metres (16 ft) in height, having distinctive gray bark. The  plant grows upright with a rounded habit and oppositely arranged leaves  and terminally born flowers. The white flowers are small, with four petals, and clustered together in rounded, 2-inch-wide (51 mm) clusters called cymose panicles,  produced in May and early June. After flowering, green fruits are  produced that turn white in late summer. The white fruits, or drupes, are attached to the plant by bright red pedicels.  Many species of birds feed on the fruits. Old branches grow slowly,  while new stems are fast growing. In the fall the foliage can take on a  reddish or purplish color, though it is not overly showy from a  distance.

Red osier dogwood	Cornus stolonifera	In the wild, it commonly grows in areas of damp soil, such as wetlands. It is a medium to tall deciduous shrub, growing 1.5–4 m tall and 3–5 m wide, spreading readily by underground stolons  to form dense thickets. The branches and twigs are dark red, although  wild plants may lack this coloration in shaded areas. The leaves  are opposite, 5–12 cm long and 2.5–6 cm broad, with an ovate to oblong  shape and an entire margin; they are dark green above and glaucous below; fall color is commonly bright red to purple. The flowers are small (5–10 mm diameter), dull white, in clusters 3–6 cm diameter. The fruit is a globose white berry 5–9 mm diameter. The Latin specific epithet sericea means "silky", referring to the texture of the leaves.[4]			Cornus alba, Cornus baileyi, Cornus interior, Cornus instolonea, Cornus sericea, Cornus californica, Swida baileyi, Swida interior, Swida instolonea, Swida stolonifera	Dogwood (Cornaceae)	native	potentially invasive							white	cyme	radial	4	Jun, Jul	opposite	simple	ovate, lanceolate	entire	yes	branched	round	hairless, fuzzy	203, 203	upright no/few branches, upright branching	patches, bunches, singular		
Crown-vetch, Axseed	Coronilla varia	Securigera varia, commonly known as Crown Vetch or Purple Crown Vetch, is a low-growing legume vine. It is native to Africa, Asia and Europe and is commonly used throughout the United States and Canada for erosion control, roadside planting and soil rehabilitation. It has become an invasive species in many states of the US. Crown Vetch grows 1 to 2 feet tall and bears small clusters of 1/2-inch pink and white flowers  from early summer to late fall. The variety Penngift produces mounds of  pink flowers. Crown Vetch is a tough, aggressive spreading plant that  will crowd out its neighbors in a show garden but is well suited to a  sunny bank, where it will grow indefinitely with little maintenance. Its  deep, tenacious roots and thick, fern-like leaves provide excellent erosion control where it is used as a ground cover. Crown vetch is toxic to horses because of the presence of nitroglycosides. If consumed in large amounts, it can cause slow growth, paralysis, or even death.

White prairie-clover, Slender white prairie-clover	Dalea candida	Dalea candida is a species of flowering plant in the legume family known by the common name white prairie clover.  It is native to North America, where it can be found throughout central  Canada, the central United States, and northern Mexico. It can  sometimes be found outside its range as an introduced species.[1] It grows in many types of habitat, including several types of prairie, foothills, woods, forests, and disturbed areas. It is a perennial herb growing erect to a maximum height around a meter, its taproot growing up to five[2] or six[3] feet deep. The alternately arranged leaves are each composed of several narrow, gland-dotted, light green leaflets. The inflorescence  is a dense cylindrical spike of flowers at the tip of each stem or stem  branch. The spike is packed with the pointed green calyces of sepals, the lower ones bearing corollas of white petals and the higher ones blooming later. The fruit is a green oval legume pod containing one seed.

Queen Anne's lace, Wild carrot, Bird's nest	Daucus carota	Daucus carota is a biennial plant that grows a rosette of leaves in the spring and summer, while building up the stout taproot that stores large amounts of sugars for the plant to flower in the second year. Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between the taproot and the hypocotyl.  The latter is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the  hypocotyl is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days  after germination. Subsequent leaves, produced from the stem nodes, are  alternating (with a single leaf attached to a node, and the leaves growing in alternate directions) and compound, and arranged in a spiral. The leaf blades are pinnate.  As the plant grows, the bases of the cotyledon are pushed apart. The  stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes  are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates, the tip of the stem  narrows and becomes pointed, extends upward, and becomes a highly  branched inflorescence. The stems grow to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.  The inflorescence is a compound umbel,  and each umbel contains several umbellets. The first (primary) umbel  occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow  from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and  even later-flowering umbels. A large primary umbel can contain up to 50  umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent  umbels have fewer flowers. Flowers are small and white, sometimes with a  light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx.

Daisy fleabane, Lesser daisy fleabane	Erigeron strigosus	Erigeron strigosus is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common name plains fleabane. It is native to eastern North America, and it is present in western North America as a somewhat weedy naturalized species. This is an annual or biennial daisy reaching heights of anywhere from 30 to 80 centimeters. It has hairy, petioled, oval-shaped leaves a few centimeters long mostly on the lower part of the plant. The spindly, branching stem has inflorescences of several flower heads each. The tiny head is less than a centimeter wide and has white ray florets surrounding a golden center.

Rattlesnake master	Eryngium yuccifolium	Eryngium yuccifolium (Button snake-root, Rattlesnake Master) is a common herbaceous perennial plant, native to the tallgrass prairies of central and eastern North America, from Minnesota east to Ohio and south to Texas and Florida.  It grows to 1.8 m tall, with linear leaves 15–100 cm long but only  1–3 cm broad, with bristly or spiny margins and a sharp tip. The flowers are produced in dense apical umbels  1–3 cm diameter, each flower greenish-white or bluish-white, 3–4 mm  diameter. When this plant flowers, pollen matures before stigmas become  receptive to maximize outcrossing. Rattlesnake master has unusually high  seed set (close to 90%).[1] It gets its name because some Native Americans used its root as an antidote for rattlesnake venom. The scientific name was given because its leaves resemble those of yuccas.  Fibers of Rattlesnake Master have also been found as one of the primary  materials used in the ancient shoe construction of Midwestern Native  Americans.[2] E. yuccifolium is fairly intolerant of anthropogenic disturbance,[3] but readily re-establishes in prairie restorations				Parsely, Carrot (Apiaceae)	native								white	cyme	radial	5	Jul, Aug	basal	simple	linear	coarsely toothed, finely toothed	no	parallel	round	hairless	91, 23	upright no/few branches	bunches, singular		
Tall boneset, Upland boneset, Tall eupatorium, Tall thoroughwort	Eupatorium altissimum	Eupatorium altissimum is a perennial plant whose native range includes much of the eastern United States and Canada. It almost always grows on limestone soils, as does Brickellia eupatorioides, which it is potentially confused with. It can hybridize with Eupatorium serotinum.[2] It is part of Eupatorium  even when that genus is defined narrowly, to include about 40 species  of mostly white-flowered plants of North America, Asia, and Europe.[3][4]			Ageratina altissima, Ageratum altissimum, Eupatorium urticaefolium	Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	native								white	cyme	bilateral	more	Jul, Aug, Sept	opposite	simple	lanceolate, linear, oblong	coarsely toothed, finely toothed	no	branched, parallel	round	fuzzy	124, 33	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular		
Spotted Joe-Pye weed	Eutrochium maculatum	Eutrochium maculatum (spotted Joe-Pye weed) is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America, ranging from Missouri east to the Atlantic Ocean and as far north as Ontario and Quebec, south to Kentucky.[1] It is an herbaceous perennial growing to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) with rose-purple flowers in late summer.[2] The binomial name maculatum, meaning spotted, refers to the purple spots on the stem.[3] Spotted Joe-Pye weed thrives in marshes, rich fens and swamps. It  also does well in man-made moist expanses such as ditches, seepage areas  and wet fields.

Common boneset, Thoroughwort, Boneset	Eupatorium perfoliatum	The Eupatorium perfoliatum plant grows about 1m tall, with leaves that clasp the stems and dense clusters of white heads held above the foliage. The leaves growing together around the stem lead to a past  superstition that wrapping the leaves in bandages around splints would  help mend broken bones.[3] Boneset also had other medical uses,[3] and was a very common remedy in the United States in the 19th century.[4] The common name boneset apparently derives from the plant's historical use in treating dengue fever (which is also known as breakbone).[5] E. perfoliatum can form hybrids with other species of the genus Eupatorium, for example Eupatorium serotinum				Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	native								white	corymb, cyme	bilateral	more	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite	simple	cordiform	finely toothed	no	branched	round	hairy	91, 23	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular		
White snakeroot	Ageratina altissima	Also known as white snakeroot,[2] richweed,[2] white sanicle,[citation needed] or tall boneset,[citation needed] is a poisonous perennial herb in the family Asteraceae, native to eastern North America. An older binomial name for this species was Eupatorium rugosum, but the genus Eupatorium has undergone taxonomic revision by botanists and a number of the species once included there have been moved to other genera. Plants are upright or sometimes ascending, growing to 1.5 meters  tall, producing single or multi-stemmed clumps. They are found in woods  and brush thickets where they bloom mid to late summer or fall. The  flowers are a clean white color and after blooming, small seeds with  fluffy white tails are released to blow in the wind. This species is  adaptive to different growing conditions and can be found in open shady  areas with open bare ground; it can be weedy in shady landscapes and in  hedgerows. There are two different varieties Ageratina altissima var. angustata and Ageratina altissima var. roanensis (Appalachian white snakeroot); they differ in the length of the flower phyllaries and shape of the apices			Ageratina altissima, Ageratum altissimum, Eupatorium urticaefolium	Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	native	potentially invasive, hazardous							white	cyme, corymb	bilateral	more	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite	simple	ovate	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	round	hairy, fuzzy	79, 28	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular		
Upland boneset	Eupatorium sessilifolium	Upland Boneset has stems that grow from 50 to over 100 centimeters tall. They are produced from a caudice or short rhizome.  The top of the stems, where the branching begins to the flower heads,  have short hairs, while the lower part of the stems have no hairs. The  leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are toothed. The leaf bases  are rounded and the leaves are sessile (lacking stalks), but they do not  clasp around the stem. The foliage is dotted with glands. Eupatorium sessilifolium blooms in August and September (July in the southern part of its range), and the small inflorescences are branched and composed of widely-spaced, white flower heads in corymbiform arrays. The heads typically have five or six disc florets per head, and no ray florets.[2][3] Upland Boneset has a wide distribution within the eastern and central United States,[4] but is endangered in Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Vermont.

Leafy Spurge	Euphorbia esula	Euphorbia esula, commonly known as green spurge or leafy spurge, is a species of spurge native to central and southern Europe (north to England, the Netherlands, and Germany), and eastward through most of Asia north of the Himalaya to Korea and eastern Siberia.[1][2][3] It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 1-1.2 m tall, with several stems branched from the base. The stems are smooth, hairless or slightly hairy. The leaves are small, lanceolate, 4-8.5 cm long and up to 1 cm broad, with a slightly wavy margin. The flowers are small, produced in umbels with a basal pair of bright yellow-green petal-like bracts.  Clusters of the bracts appear in late spring, while the actual flowers  do not develop until early summer. All parts of the plant contain a  toxic white milky sap.[3][4] It reproduces readily by seeds that have a high germination rate and may remain viable in the soil for at least seven years. The seed capsules  open explosively, dispersing seed up to 5 m from the parent plant, and  may be carried further by water and wildlife. Leafy Spurge also spreads  vegetatively from the root system, which is complex, reported to reach 8 m into the ground and 5 m across, and may have numerous buds.

Cream gentian, Pale gentian, Yellow gentian	Gentiana alba	Gentiana alba (called Plain, Pale, White, Cream, or Yellow Gentian) is a herbaceous species of flowering plant in the Gentian family Gentianaceae,  producing yellowish-white colored flowers from thick white taproots. It  is native to North America from Manitoba through Ontario in the north,  south to Oklahoma, Arkansas and North Carolina, and it is listed as  rare, endangered, threatened or extirpated in parts of this range. [1] This species resembles Bottle Gentian (Gentiana andrewsii), which has blue flowers and a less upright habit, and shares much of the same range. Gentiana alba starts to bloom a few weeks earlier than Bottle Gentian and the flowers are more open at the tops. Gentiana alba can also hybridize with Gentiana andrewsii, producing upright growing plants having white flowers with blue edges. Synonyms include Gentiana flavida A.

Bottle gentian, Andrews' gentian, Prairie closed gentian, Fringe-tip closed gentian	Gentiana andrewsii	Gentiana andrewsii (Bottle gentian, Closed gentian, or Closed bottle gentian) is a herbaceous species of flowering plant in the Gentian family Gentianaceae. Plants are native to northeastern North America from the Dakotas to  the East coast and bloom in late summer (August-October). The flowers  are 2 to 4 cm long, typically a rich blue color and bottle shaped with  closed mouths. The flowers are clustered at the top of the plant or in  the axis of the top leaves. The stems are 30 to 60 cm long, lax in  habit, producing sprawling plants with upturned ends ending with  clusters of bee pollinated flowers. The foliage is hairless with a  glossy sheen to it. Plants are fed upon by ground hogs and scale  insects. This species can hybridize with Gentiana alba,  producing upright growing plants with white flowers with blue edges.  This gentian is considered a threatened species in the USA states of New York and Maryland.[1]			Dasystephana andrewsii, Pneumonanthe andrewsii	Gentian (Gentianaceae)	native								blue, purple	head	radial	5	Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite	simple	lanceolate, ovate, cordiform	entire	no	parallel	round	hairless	61, 18	upright no/few branches	singular, bunches

Saw-tooth sunflower	Helianthus grosseserratus	Helianthus grosseserratus, commonly known as sawtooth sunflower or thick-tooth sunflower[2] , is a perennial sunflower in the family Asteraceae, with a large flowering head (inflorescence). The plant may reach 3–12 feet (91–366 cm) in height and is found  along streams, damp prairies and roadsides in the eastern parts of Canada and the USA.[2] It prefers full sun and moist, fertile loamy soil with high organic content.[3] The lanceolate  leaves are simple and alternate and may reach 4 to 12 inches (10–30 cm)  long and from 1 to 4 inches (2–10 cm) wide. The leaf margins are  sharply toothed (hence the name, sawtooth) to occasionally nearly entire and the tips are pointed. The head  (formally composite flower) is 3 to 4 inches (7–10 cm) wide with  golden-yellow disk flowers that bloom in summer and autumn. The 10-20  yellow petals are about 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) long. The fruit is a single  achene within a husk. Various insects, birds and mammals–including cattle–feed on either the plant or its seeds.[3][4] Native Americans used to treat burns with a poultice made from the flowers			Helianthus instabilis	Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	native								yellow	panicle	radial	more	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite, alternate	simple	lanceolate	coarsely toothed, finely toothed	yes	branched	round	hairless	203, 43	upright no/few branches, upright branching	singular, bunches		
Showy sunflower	Helianthus pauciflorus	Prairie Sunflower can be variable in appearance. With respect to the flowers, the disk florets are usually reddish brown (maroon), however sometimes they are yellow in appearance; there are usually 10-15 ray florets, but sometimes as many as 25. Similarly, the leaves are often 1" across or less, but sometimes wider. These variations may be the result of hybridization, or the existence of subspecies that remain to be identified. This sunflower species can be distinguished from others by the rough texture of its leaves and stems, the short stout petioles, and the lanceolate shape of its leaves. In addition, the floral bracts (phyllaries) are triangular in shape and more wide than those of most other sunflowers. Prairie Sunflower is more xerophytic than many other sunflowers in Illinois, favoring dry upland areas in full sunlight. Another scientific name for this plant is Helianthus rigidus, but it is considered obsolete.

Ox-eye sunflower, False sunflower, Sunflower-everlasting	Heliopsis helianthoides	Heliopsis helianthoides is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, known by the common names smooth oxeye and false sunflower.[1] It is native to eastern North America, including eastern Canada and the eastern United States.[2][3] This species is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial  growing 40–150 cm (16–59 in) tall. The toothed leaf blades are oval to  triangular or lance-shaped and may be smooth or hairy or rough in  texture. The flowers are produced from midsummer to early autumn (fall).[4] The inflorescence contains one to many composite flowerheads.  Each head contains yellow ray florets which are generally 2–4 cm long.  At the center are many yellow to brownish disc florets. The fruit is an achene about 5 mm long.[2] In the wild this plant may be found in wooded areas and tallgrass prairie, and sometimes along roadsides			Buphthalmum helianthoides, Heliopsis minor, Heliopsis scabra	Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	native								yellow	cyme, solitary	radial	more	Jul, Aug, Sept	opposite	simple	ovate, lanceolate	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	round	hairless	150, 33	upright no/few branches, upright branching	singular, bunches		
Dame's rocket, Dame's violet	Hesperis matronalis	Hesperis matronalis grows 100 cm or taller, with multiple  upright, hairy stems. Typically, the first year of growth produces a  mound of foliage, and flowering occurs the second year; the plants are  normally biennials, but a number of races can be short-lived perennials. The plants have showy blooms in early to mid spring. The leaves are alternately arranged on upright stems and lanceolate-shaped; they typically have very short or lack petioles  and have toothed margins, but sometimes are entire and are widest at  the base. The foliage has short hairs on the top and bottom surfaces  that give the leaves a somewhat rough feel. The larger leaves are around  12 cm long and over 4 cm wide. In early spring, a thick mound of  low-growing foliage is produced; during flowering the lower parts of the  stems are generally unbranched and denuded of foliage and the top of  the blooming plant might have a few branches that end in inflorescences. The plentiful, fragrant flowers are produced in large, showy, terminal racemes  that can be 30+ cm tall and elongate as the flowers of the  inflorescence bloom. When stems have both flowers and fruits, the weight  sometimes causes the stems to bend. Each flower is large (2 cm across),  with four petals.  Flower coloration varies, with different shades of lavender and purple  most common, but white, pink, and even some flowers with mixed colors  exist in cultivated forms. A few different double-flowered varieties  also exist.[2] The four petals are clawed and hairless. The flowers have six stamens in two groups, the four closest to the ovary are longer than the two oppositely positioned. Stigmas are two-lobed. The four sepals are erect and form a mock tube around the claws of the petals and are also colored similarly to the petals.[3] Some plants may bloom until August, but warm weather greatly shortens  the duration on each flower's blooming. Seeds are produced in thin  fruits 5–14 cm long pods, containing two rows of seeds separated by a  dimple. The fruit are terete and open by way of glabrous valves, constricted between the seeds like a pea pod. Seeds are oblong, 3–4 mm long and 1–1.5 mm wide				Mustard (Brassicaceae)	nonnative	invasive							purple, pink, white	raceme	radial	4	May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept	alternate	simple	lanceolate, ovate	finely toothed	no	branched	round	hairy	71, 18	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

Common St John's-wort, Klamath weed, St. John's-wort	Hypericum perforatum	Hypericum perforatum is a yellow-flowering, stoloniferous or sarmentose, perennial herb indigenous to Europe.  It has been introduced to many temperate areas of the world and grows  wild in many meadows. The herb's common name comes from its traditional  flowering and harvesting on St John's day, 24 June. The genus name Hypericum is derived from the Greek words hyper (above) and eikon  (picture), in reference to the plant's traditional use in warding off  evil by hanging plants over a religious icon in the house during St  John's day. The species name perforatum  refers to the presence of small oil glands in the leaves that look like  windows, which can be seen when they are held against the light.[1] St John's wort is a perennial plant with extensive, creeping rhizomes.  Its stems are erect, branched in the upper section, and can grow to 1 m  high. It has opposing, stalkless, narrow, oblong leaves that are 12 mm  long or slightly larger. The leaves are yellow-green in color, with  transparent dots throughout the tissue and occasionally with a few black  dots on the lower surface.[1] Leaves exhibit obvious translucent dots when held up to the light, giving them a ‘perforated’ appearance, hence the plant's Latin name. Its flowers measure up to 2.5 cm across, have five petals, and are  colored bright yellow with conspicuous black dots. The flowers appear in  broad cymes at the ends of the upper branches, between late spring and early to mid summer. The sepals are pointed, with glandular dots in the tissue. There are many stamens, which are united at the base into three bundles. The pollen grains are ellipsoidal.[1] When flower buds (not the flowers themselves) or seed pods are crushed, a reddish/purple liquid is produced.

Orange jewelweed, Orange touch-me-not, Spotted touch-me-not	Impatiens capensis	Impatiens capensis, the Orange Jewelweed, Common Jewelweed, Spotted Jewelweed, Spotted Touch-me-not,[1] or Orange Balsam, is an annual plant native to North America. It is common in bottomland soils, ditches, and along creeks, often growing side-by-side with its less common relative, Yellow Jewelweed (I. pallida). The flowers are orange with a three-lobed corolla; one of the calyx  lobes is colored similarly to the corolla and forms a hooked conical  spur at the back of the flower. Plants may also produce non-showy cleistogamous flowers, which do not require cross-pollination.[2] The stems are somewhat translucent, succulent, and have swollen or darkened nodes. The seed pods are pendant and have projectile  seeds that explode out of the pods when they are lightly touched, if  ripe, which is where the name 'touch-me-not' comes from. The leaves  appear to be silver or 'jeweled' when held underwater, which is possibly  where the jewelweed name comes from. Along with other species of jewelweed it is a traditional remedy for skin rashes, although controlled studies have not shown efficacy for this purpose.

Round-headed bush clover, Round-headed lespedeza	Lespedeza capitata	Lespedeza capitata is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae, or legume family, and is known by the common name roundhead bushclover, or roundhead lespedeza.[1] It is native to eastern North America, including eastern Canada and the eastern half of the United States.[2] This plant is a perennial herb with erect stems growing up to 1.5 meters tall. The taproot  may grow over two meters deep into the soil, with lateral roots  reaching out one meter horizontally. The alternately arranged leaves are  each made up of several leaflets. The plant is coated in silvery hairs.  Flowers are borne in somewhat rounded clusters atop each stem. The  flower is white with a purple spot.[3] In the wild this plant grows in wooded areas, on prairies, and in disturbed habitat such as roadsides. It is tolerant of drought.[4] It fixes nitrogen.[3] This plant is used as a component of seed mixes for vegetating  rangeland. It is a good addition to livestock forage, as it is palatable  and nutritious.[3] The seeds are part of the diet of the Bobwhite Quail.[5] The plant can also be used in flower arrangements.[3] This plant had a number of medicinal uses for Native American groups. It was used as a moxa to treat rheumatism. The Comanche used the leaves for tea.[5] The Meskwaki used the roots to make an antidote for poison.[6] The Pawnee people referred to the plant as rabbit foot, while the Omaha and Ponca peoples gave it the name male buffalo bellow plant			Lespedeza bicknellii, Lespedeza longifolia, Lespedeza velutina	Bean, Pea (Fabaceae)	native								white, green, yellow	head, spike	bilateral	5	Jul, Aug, Sept	alternate	trifoliate	divided, linear, oblong	entire	yes	branched	round, ridged	fuzzy, hairy	109, 28	upright no/few branches	bunches, singular

It is native to north eastern and central North America, where it is  found in habitats such as prairies, limestone and sandstone outcropings,  bluffs, barrens, and glades and dunes. It is also found along roadsides  and in sandy pine-oak, wooded northern slope plant communities. It  blooms in mid to late summer with purple flower heads. It grows from rounded or sometimes elongated corms, which produce  hairless stems 20–60 centimeters tall. The flowers are in dense heads  with 10–35 florets, and the heads lack stems or have stems that are 2–10  millimeters long that orient the heads upward. The heads maybe produced  singly or in loose to dense cluster of 2–28. They are arranged in dense  spike-like or raceme-like collections. The basal and cauline  leaves have three nerves (some might have five), they are long and  thin, ranging from 8–25 centimeters long and 2–6 millimeters wide. The  foliage is mostly hairless or may have some hairs on the margins (some  plants in Kentucky and Missouri are hairy and may indicate hybridization  with Liatris hirsuta);  the leaves are gradually reduced in size as they ascend near the top of  the stem.

Wild bergamont, Bee balm	Monarda fistulosa	Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot) is an herbaceous perennial that grows from slender creeping rhizomes,  thus commonly occurring in large clumps. The plants are typically up to  3 ft (0.9 m) tall, with a few erect branches. Its leaves are about  2-3 in (5-8 cm) long, lance-shaped, and toothed. Its compact flower  clusters are solitary at the ends of branches. Each cluster is about  1.5 in (4 cm) long, containing about 20–50 flowers. Wild bergamot often  grows in rich soils in dry fields, thickets, and clearings, usually on limy soil. The plants generally flower from June to September.[4] Monarda fistulosa ranges from Quebec to the Northwest Territories and British Columbia, south to Georgia, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, and Washington.

Russian mulberry, White mulberry	Morus alba	On young, vigorous shoots, the leaves  may be up to 30 cm long, and deeply and intricately lobed, with the  lobes rounded. On older trees, the leaves are generally 5–15 cm long,  unlobed, cordate at the base and rounded to acuminate at the tip, and  serrated on the margins. The trees are generally deciduous in temperate regions, but trees grown in tropical regions can be evergreen. The flowers are single-sex catkins;  male catkins are 2–3.5 cm long, and female catkins 1–2 cm long. Male  and female flowers are usually on separate trees although they may occur  on the same tree.[6][7] The fruit  is 1–2.5 cm long; in the species in the wild it is deep purple, but in  many cultivated plants it varies from white to pink; it is sweet but  bland, unlike the more intense flavor of the red mulberry and black mulberry. The seeds are widely dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and excrete the seeds.[3][4][8] The white mulberry is scientifically notable for the rapid plant movement involved in pollen release from its catkins. The stamens  act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 µs. The  resulting movement is approximately 350 miles per hour (560 km/h), over  half the speed of sound, making it the fastest known movement in the plant kingdom			Morus tatarica	Mulberry (Moraceae)	nonnative	potentially invasive							green	raceme, spike	radial		Mar, Apr, May	alternate	simple	lobed, ovate, cordiform	finely toothed	yes	branched	round	hairless	711, 152	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

Blooming lasts from late spring to late summer. The flowers are hermaphrodite,  produced on a tall spike and only last until the following noon. They  open visibly fast every evening producing an interesting spectacle,  hence the name "evening primrose." The blooms are yellow, 2.5–5 cm (0.98–2.0 in) diameter, with four bilobed petals. The flower structure has an invisible to the naked eye bright nectar guide pattern. This pattern is apparent under ultraviolet light and visible to its pollinators, moths, butterflies, and bees. The fruit is a capsule 2–4 cm (0.79–1.6 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) broad, containing numerous 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long seeds, released when the capsule splits into four sections at maturity			Oenothera muricata, Oenothera pycnocarpa	Evening-primrose (Onagraceae)	native								yellow	spike	radial	4	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	alternate	simple	lanceolate, oblong, ovate	wavy, coarsely toothed	no	branched	ridged	hairy, fuzzy	104, 28	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

It is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing, herbaceous plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It has a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the nodes. The trifoliate leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a clover in shape. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, like Oxalis corniculata var. atropurpurea, have purple. The leaves have inconspicuous stipules at the base of each petiole. The fruit is a narrow, cylindrical capsule, 1 to 2 cm long and noteworthy for its explosive discharge of the contained, 1 mm long seeds			Acetosella corniculata, Oxalis langloisii, Oxalis lupulina, Oxalis pusilla, Oxalis repens, Oxalis villosa, Xanthoxalis corniculata, Xanthoxalis langloisii, Xanthoxalis repens	Wood-sorrel (Oxalidaceae)	nonnative								yellow	umbel, solitary	radial	5		alternate	trifoliate	divided, cordiform	lobed, entire	yes	branched	round	hairy	15, 13	sprawling, upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

It is native to the eastern United States.[1][2] This plant is a perennial herb growing 30 to 60 centimeters tall, but  known to exceed one meter at times. The glandular leaves are oval to  lance-shaped and variable in size. They have serrated, toothed, or lobed  edges. The inflorescence is an array of several flower heads containing whitish disc flowers and 5 to 6 ray flowers.[2] The "flowers have a pleasant but mild medicinal fragrance."[3] This plant grows in disturbed areas[2] as well as prairies, woods, and hillsides. It tolerates hot and cold climates and can be used as a garden plant in many areas.[3] The leaves of the plant contain tannins and the plant was used for medicinal and veterinary purposes by Native Americans. The Catawba people used it as a poultice to treat burns. The ashes were applied to horses with "sore backs".[3][4] The roots were made into a tea to treat dysentery.

Wild parsnip	Pastinaca sativa	The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tend to be favored by food processors, as they are more resistant to breakage. The plant has an apical meristem that produces a rosette of pinnate leaves. The lower leaves are petiolate, the upper leaves are sessile, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The highly branched floral stem is hollow and grooved, and can grow to more than 150 cm (60 in) tall.[2] Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n=22.[3] The wild parsnip from which the modern cultivated varieties were  derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly  on chalk and limestone.[4] It is a biennial with a rosette of roughly hairy leaves that has a pungent odor when crushed. The petioles  are grooved and have sheathed bases. The leaves are once- or  twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed  margins; they grow up to 40 cm (16 in) long. The flower stalk develops  in the second year, growing to a height of 40 to 200 cm (20 to 80 in).  It is hairy, grooved, hollow (except at the nodes), and sparsely  branched. It has a few stalkless, single-lobed leaves measuring 5 to 10  cm (2 to 4 in) long that are arranged in opposite pairs. The yellow  flowers are in a loose, compound umbel measuring 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) in diameter. There are 6–25 straight pedicels,  each measuring 2–5 cm (1–2 in) that support the umbellets (secondary  umbels). The umbels and umbellets usually have no upper or lower bracts. The flowers have tiny or absent sepals, and measure about 3.5 mm. They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward, five stamens, and one pistil. The fruits, or schizocarps, are oval and flat, with narrow wings and short, spreading styles. They are colored straw to light brown, and measure 4–8 mm long				Parsely, Carrot (Apiaceae)	nonnative	invasive, hazardous							yellow	umbel	radial	5	Jun, Jul	alternate	pinnate	divided, lobed	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	ridged	hairless	114, 41	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular, patches

Approximately forty varieties currently are cultivated.[1] It has an extensive Old World distribution extending from North Africa through the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent to Malesia and Australasia.  The species status in the New World is uncertain: in general, it is  considered an exotic weed, however, there is evidence that the species  was in Crawford Lake deposits (Ontario) in 1430-89 AD, suggesting that it reached North America in the pre-Columbian era.[2] It is naturalised elsewhere and in some regions is considered an invasive weed. It has smooth, reddish, mostly prostrate stems and alternate leaves clustered at stem joints and ends. The yellow flowers  have five regular parts and are up to 6 mm wide. Depending upon  rainfall, the flowers appear at anytime during the year. The flowers  open singly at the center of the leaf  cluster for only a few hours on sunny mornings. Seeds are formed in a  tiny pod, which opens when the seeds are mature. Purslane has a taproot with fibrous secondary roots and is able to tolerate poor, compacted soils and drought.Portulaca oleracea (Common Purslane, also known as Verdolaga, Pigweed, Little Hogweed, or Pursley, and Moss rose) is an annual succulent in the family Portulacaceae, which may reach 40 cm in height.

Prairie cinquefoil, Tall cinquefoil, Tall potentilla, 	Potentilla arguta	Drymocallis arguta, commonly known as the tall cinquefoil, sulphur cinquefoil or sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial plant in the Rosaceae family of flowering plants native to North America. It was formerly included with the typical cinquefoils in the genus Potentilla. D. arguta is thought to be a protocarnivorous plant. In a 1999 experiment, several plants in the Pacific Northwest were tested for the carnivorous syndrome, using the digestion of proteins as the diagnostic tool to determine which plants appeared to produce protease enzymes capable of breaking down potential prey. D. arguta displayed a capability to digest and absorb the 14C-labeled  algal protein placed on its sticky trichomes. However, it is not known  whether the digestive enzymes were produced by the plant itself or  surface microbes.[1]			Drymocallis agrimonioides, Drymocallis arguta, Geum agrimonioides	Rose (Rosaceae)	native								white, yellow	cyme	radial	5	Jun, Jul	alternate	pinnate	divided, ovate, elliptic	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	round	fuzzy	64, 28	upright no/few branches	bunches, singular

It is native to Eurasia but it is present in North America as an introduced species, ranging through almost the entire continent except the northernmost part of Canada and Alaska. The plant probably originated in the Mediterranean Basin, and it was first collected in the 19th century in Ontario and in 1914 in British Columbia.[1] It is known as a minor noxious weed in some areas.[1] It occurs in many types of habitat, including disturbed, weedy places. This perennial herb is a tufted plant growing from a woody taproot or caudex.  It produces upright to erect leafy stems up to 80 centimeters tall. The  leaves are palmate, divided into usually 6 or 7 leaflets, sometimes up  to nine. The green to yellow-green leaves may be up to 15 centimeters  long, with the central leaflet reaching 8 centimeters in length. The  leaflets are hairy in texture and toothed along the edges. The inflorescence  is a cyme of several flowers which are generally light to pale yellow  in color, with white to gold-flowered individuals occurring at times.  The plant may reproduce by seed or vegetatively by sprouting new shoots from its caudex.[1]			Potentilla pilosa, Potentilla sulphurea	Rose (Rosaceae)	nonnative								yellow	cyme	radial	5	Jun, Jul, Aug	alternate	trifoliate, palmate	divided, obovate	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	round	hairy	58, 30	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

Heal-all, Lawn prunella, Selfheal	Prunella vulgaris	Prunella vulgaris grows 5 to 30 cms high[2] (2-12inches), with creeping, self-rooting, tough, square, reddish stems branching at leaf axis.[3] The leaves are lance shaped, serrated, and reddish at tip, about 2.5  cms (1 inch) long and 1.5 cms (half an inch) broad, and growing in  opposite pairs down the square stem.[3]  Each leave has 3-7 veins that shoot off of the middle vein to the  margin. The stalks of the leaves are generally short, but can be up to 5  cms (2 inches) long.[4] The flowers grow from a clublike, somewhat square, whirled cluster;  immediately below this club are a pair of stalkless leaves standing out  on either side like a collar. Flowers are two lipped and tubular. The  top lip is a purple hood, and the bottom lip is often white; it has  three lobes with the middle lobe being larger and fringed upwardly.  Flowers bloom at different times depending on climate and other  conditions, but mostly in summer (from June to August in the USA).[3] Self-heal propagates both by seed and vegetatively by creeping stems that root at the nodes.[5]			Prunella parviflora, Prunella pennsylvanica	Mint (Lamiaceae)	native								blue, purple	spike, head	bilateral	5	Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite	simple	lanceolate, ovate, oblong	entire, coarsely toothed	yes	branched	ridged, square	hairy	28, 25	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

Common dandelion	Taraxacum officinale	Taraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots  and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically 5 to 40 cm  tall, but sometimes up to 70 cm tall. The stems can be tinted purplish,  they are upright or lax, and produce flower heads that are held as tall  or taller than the foliage. The foliage is upright-growing or  horizontally orientated; the leaves have petioles that are either  unwinged or narrowly winged. The stems can be glabrous or sparsely  covered with short hairs. Plants have milky latex  and the leaves are all basal; each flowering stem lacks bracts and has  one single flower head. The yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts  and all the flowers, which are called florets, are ligulate and bisexual. The fruits are mostly produced by apomixis.[6] The leaves are 5 to 45 cm long and 1 to 10 cm wide, and are  oblanceolate, oblong, or obovate in shape, with the bases gradually  narrowing to the petiole. The leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed  to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth.[6] The calyculi (the cuplike bracts that hold the florets) are composed  of 12 to 18 segments: each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous.  The lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series, with the apices  acuminate in shape. The 14- to 25-mm wide involucres are green to dark  green or brownish-green, with the tips dark gray or purplish. The  florets number 40 to over 100 per head, having corollas that are yellow  or orange-yellow in color. The fruits, called cypselae, range in color from olive-green or  olive-brown to straw-colored to grayish, they are oblanceoloid in shape  and 2 to 3 mm long with slender beaks. The fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that  have sharp edges. The silky pappi,  which form the parachutes, are white to silver-white in color and  around 6 mm wide. Plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes  but some plants have 16 or 32 chromosomes.[7]				Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)	nonnative								yellow	head	radial	more	Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov	basal	simple	lobed, divided, obovate	coarsely toothed, lobed	yes	branched	round	hairless	33, 25	upright no/few branches, upright branching	singular

Poison ivy, Common eastern poison ivy	Toxicodendron radicans	Toxicodendron radicans, commonly known as poison ivy (older synonyms are Rhus toxicodendron and Rhus radicans),[1] is a poisonous North American plant that is well known for its production of urushiol, a clear liquid compound found within the sap of the plant that causes an itching, irritation and sometimes painful rash in most people who touch it.[2] The plant is not a true ivy (Hedera). Poison ivy can be found growing in any of the following forms: as a trailing vine that is 10–25 centimetres (3.9–9.8 in) tallas a shrub up to 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) tallas a climbing vine that grows on trees or some other support			Toxicodendron negundo	Cashew (Anacardiaceae)	native	hazardous							yellow	panicle, raceme		5	May, Jun	alternate	trifoliate	divided, ovate	lobed	yes	branched	round	hairy, fuzzy, hairless	53, 38	sprawling, upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular, patches		
Ohio spiderwort, Common spiderwort, Smooth spiderwort, Blue jacket	Tradescantia ohiensis	Tradescantia ohiensis, commonly known as bluejacket or Ohio spiderwort, is an herbaceous plant species in the genus Tradescantia native to eastern North America. It is the most common and widely distributed species of Tradescantia in the United States, where it can be found from Massachusetts in the north, west to Minnesota, and south to Texas and Florida. It also has a very small distribution in Canada in extreme southern Ontario near Windsor. Distinguishing features of the species include glaucous  leaves and stems, leaves forming an acute angle with the stems, sepals  with hairs lacking glands which are confined to the apex if present at  all, and a relatively tall habit (up to about 115 cm). Typical habitats  for the plant include roadsides, along railroads, and in fields and  thickets. Less typically it can occur in woods, and sometimes along  streams. As with many species in the genus, it is often forms hybrids  with related species where they co-occur. More specifically, at least  nine different species are thought to be capable of forming hybrids with  T. ohiensis.[1]			Tradescantia canaliculata, Tradescantia foliosa, Tradescantia incarnata, Tradescantia reflexa	Spiderwort (Commelinaceae)	native								blue, purple, pink	cyme	radial	3	Apr, May, Jun, Jul	alternate	simple	linear	entire	no	parallel	round	hairless	79, 25	upright no/few branches	bunches, singular

Stinging nettle	Urtica dioica	Stinging nettle is a dioecious herbaceous perennial,  1 to 2 m (3 to 7 ft) tall in the summer and dying down to the ground in  winter. It has widely spreading rhizomes and stolons, which are bright  yellow as are the roots. The soft green leaves  are 3 to 15 cm (1 to 6 in) long and are borne oppositely on an erect  wiry green stem. The leaves have a strongly serrated margin, a cordate  base and an acuminate tip with a terminal leaf tooth longer than  adjacent laterals. It bears small greenish or brownish numerous flowers  in dense axillary inflorescences. The leaves and stems are very hairy  with non-stinging hairs and also bear many stinging hairs (trichomes), whose tips come off when touched, transforming the hair into a needle that will inject several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), moroidin,[2] leukotrienes,[2] and possibly formic acid.[3][4] This mixture of chemical compounds cause a painful sting or paresthesia from which the species derives its common name, as well as the colloquial names burn nettle, burn weed, burn hazel.

Common mullein, Flannel plant, Giant mullein	Verbascum thapsus	Verbascum thapsus is a dicotyledonous plant that produces a rosette of leaves in its first year of growth.[2][3]  The leaves are large, up to 50 cm long. The second year plants normally  produce a single unbranched stem usually 1–2 m tall. In the East of its  range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5 m tall.[4] The tall pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers[2] that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes.[4][5] This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n = 36.[6] On flowering plants the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50 cm long and 14 cm across (19 inches long and 5 inches wide).[7][8] They become smaller higher up the stem,[2][3] and less strongly decurrent down the stem.[2] The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5 cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence,[3] usually following damage.[9] After flowering and seed release the stem and fruits usually persist in winter,[10]  drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed,  ovoid-shaped and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the  following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.[8] 				Snapdragon (Scrophulariaceae)	nonnative	potentially invasive 							yellow	spike	radial	5	Jun, Jul, Aug, Sept	basal, alternate	simple	oblong, obovate, spatulate	entire, finely toothed	no	branched	square, ridged	fuzzy	147, 41	upright no/few branches	singular		
Blue vervain, Simpler's joy, Swamp verbena	Verbena hastata	Verbena hastata (Blue Vervain or Swamp Verbena) is a flowering plant in the vervain family, Verbenaceae. It is a herb with opposite, simple leaves  which have double-serate margins, borne on stiffly erect, branching  square stems. The flowers appear in summer and are purple. This is a  common plant that occurs across North America. They are hardy and  drought resistant.[1]				Vervain (Verbenaceae)	native								blue, pink, purple	spike, raceme	radial	5	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite	simple	lanceolate	coarsely toothed	yes	branched	square, ridged	hairy	74, 28	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

White vervain, Nettle-leaved vervain	Verbena urticifolia	Verbena urticifolia (White Vervain) is a herbaceous plant in the vervain family (Verbenaceae). It belongs to the "true" vervains of genus Verbena.  The Urtica-like leaves were the reason for the scientifiv name urticifolia. White Vervain has opposite, simple leaves on thin, rigid, green stems. The leaves look similar to those of Urtica, which is the reason for the plant being named urticifolia. The small flowers are borne in spikes; they open in summer and unusually for this normally bluish-flowered genus are white. It might be closest to a group that might include such North American species as V. lasiostachys or V. menthifolia, and the Common Vervain (V. officinalis) from Europe. As these, it is diploid with 14 chromosomes altogether. The relationship of the Swamp Verbena (V. hastata) to these species is more enigmatic; its evolution might have involved hybridization with the White Vervain or a related species in the past.[1]				Vervain (Verbenaceae)	native								white	spike, raceme	radial	5	Jul, Aug, Sept, Oct	opposite	simple	lanceolate, ovate	coarsely toothed, finely toothed, doubly toothed	yes	branched	ridged, square	hairy	104, 38	upright no/few branches	bunches, singular

Nutt., Veronica virginica L.[1][2]) is a wildflower native to the United States. It is cultivated as a garden flower in the Eastern United States.[2] Veronicastrum virginicum is an erect perennial herb that grows  80–200 cm in height. The leaves are serrated and arranged in whorls of  3-7 around the stem. The inflorescence is erect with slender and  spike-like racemes. The stamens are crowded and protrude in a brush-like  fashion perpendicular to the raceme . The corollas are white and are  roughly 2 mm. in length. These plants flower from mid-summer to early  fall.[3] Culver's Root is frequently found in wet to wet-mesic prairies and sometimes moist upland sites.[3]			Leptandra virginica, Veronica virginica	Snapdragon (Scrophulariaceae)	native								white	spike, raceme	radial	4	Jul, Aug	whorled	simple	lanceolate, elliptic	finely toothed	yes, no	branched	round	hairless	112, 33	upright no/few branches, upright branching	bunches, singular

Summer grape	Vitis aestivalis	Vitis aestivalis (Summer Grape) is a species of grape native to eastern North America from southern Ontario east to Vermont, west to Oklahoma, and south to Florida and Texas.[1] It is a vigorous vine, growing to 10 m or more high in trees. The leaves  are 7–20 cm long, suborbicular, and usually a little broader than long;  they are variable in shape, from unlobed to deeply three- or  five-lobed, green above, and densely hairy below. The flowers are produced in a dense panicle 5–15 cm long. The fruit is a small grape 5–14 mm diameter, dark purple or black in color.[2] It is the official state grape of Missouri.[3] There are four varieties:[1] Vitis aestivalis var. aestivalis.Vitis aestivalis var. bicolor Deam (syn. var. argentifolia Fernald; Silverleaf Grape), formerly called Vitis bicolor, but now considered a northern variation of Vitis aestivalis. Native range is in the Northeastern United States and parts of Southern Ontario.Vitis aestivalis var. lincecumii (Buckley) Munson.Vitis aestivalis var. bourquiniana, native to the south, sometimes called Vitis bourquiniana, has tomentose undersides to the leaves.

Frost grape, River bank grape	Vitis riparia	Mature vines have loose, fissured bark, and may attain several inches in diameter. Leaves are alternate, often with opposite tendrils  or inflorescences, coarsely toothed, 5–25 cm (2–10in) long and 5–20 cm  (2–8in) broad, sometimes with sparse hairs on the underside of veins. The inflorescence is paniculate 4–15 cm (1.5–6 in) long and loose, and the flowers are small, fragrant, dioecious, and white or greenish in color. V. riparia blooms in May or June and produces a small 6–15 mm blue-black berry (grape) with a bloom, seeded, juicy, edible, vinous in flavor, lacking the "foxy" characteristics of Vitis labrusca, but usually quite sour and herbaceous. V. riparia has a wide range and may deviate considerably in detail from the above general description. White berries, perfect flowers,  large clusters, large berries, and sweet fruit are among the known  variations. However, some observers consider such variations as evidence  of natural hybridization with other species of grapes.

Golden Alexanders is hardy in USDA zones 4-9. It can be found from New Brunswick to Saskatchewan in Canada, south to Florida and Texas in the United States.[1] This native North American flower usually ranges in height from forty  centimeters to seventy five centimeters tall but can sometimes grow  taller. The leaves of the Golden Alexanders can up to eight centimeters  long and five centimeters wide. They are normally lanceolate or ovate in  shape. Other distinguishing factors of the leaves are that they have  serrated edges as well as two or three lobes in the leaf. Golden Alexanders blooms from May to June. Their flowers are yellow  in color and bunched at the top of the plant. Each flower is only three  millimeters long and has five sepals, five petals, and five stamens.  Each flower produces a single three to four millimeter long, oblong,  green fruit capsule. These fruit change color as the year goes on and  contain a brown seed. In the fall both the leave and the fruit turn  purple.
